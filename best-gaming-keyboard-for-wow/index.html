              <h2>Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition</h2>

              <p><b>4.7 out of 5 & 8,992 global ratings at Amazon</b></p>

              <p>Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition (TE in short) is an excellent mechanical gaming keyboard. Optomechanical switches are used in this keyboard from Razer. The keys are very responsive and provide a very smooth gaming and typing experience. Also available RGB backlighting.  Razer's Synapse 3 software can be used to customize the backlighting. Premium choice for mechanical lover WOW shadowland players. 
</p>

<p>The tournament edition mainly refers to the TKL ( ten key less ) layout. There are lots of features as well as the optical switches in this Razer Huntsman keyboard. One of the most interesting factors is the simplicity of this gaming keyboard. Unlike traditional Razer gaming keyboards, this model is very simple looking which is very much of an improvement from Razer. The font is also very simple, Razer didn’t use the traditional aggressive gaming font. 
</p>

<p>The keyboard is very light weight because of the premium quality plastic built. Keycaps are made of PBT which are better than ABS keycaps, the finishing on the top of the keycaps has a very nice texture. The backside of the keyboard contains two separate degrees of elevation, one is 6 degrees and the other is 9 degrees in order to set up according to your comfort. The cable along with the keyboard is removable and USB type C. Optomechanical switches are used in all the Razer Huntsman keyboards, this tournament edition contains liniar red switches. </p>

<p>They are faster and lighter than other optomechanical switches. The switches respond in the slightest press of 1 millimeter. This may cause unintended keystroke or register. These liniar red switches are a bit louder than the traditional red switches. There are 5 profiles of RGB lighting effects stored on the keyboard itself. You need to have the Razer’s Synapse software to use the 5 onboard storage. You can set up different RGB light effects using Synapse and the colors are very bright, vibrant, smooth and premium looking. The stabilizers of the keycaps have a bit of room for improvement. So our WOW gamers can’t really complain on price according to the tremendous features they are getting. 
</p>

              <p>Apex 7 is a premium quality mechanical gaming keyboard from the famous brand SteelSeries. This model is a TKL (ten key less) version which means reduced width of the keyboard by removing the 10 digit number pad also with red liniar and quiet switches. Blue tactile and clicky, brown tactile and quiet switches and non tkl versions are also available from Amazon. Another outstanding feature comes with this mechanical keyboard is the OLED display at the right upper corner. 
</p>

<p>This exclusive keyboard for WOW players contains a floating key design with plastic base and aircraft aluminium alloy base plate. Relatively lightweight keyboard and the rubber feet at the bottom of the keyboard helps it sit perfectly on the desk. Provided a wrist rest along with the Apex 7 which is made of plastic with a soft rubber built top. This comfortable wrist rest is connected magnetically with the keyboard which is pretty amazing. The wrist rest is not super strong but it will be in position while gaming or typing. 
</p>

You can upload images in black and white, using the button connected to the OLED you can access some of the settings of the keyboard. The OLED display doesn't do enough to be really useful.  Overall a premium mechanical keyboard according to the price and recommended for WOW players.

              <h2>Corsair K95 RGB Platinum</h2>
              
              <p><b>4.6 out of 5 & 4,247 global ratings at Amazon</b></p>

             <p>Corsair K95 is the most expensive mechanical gaming keyboard in our list. For those high budget WOW shadowland players, who are very much enthusiastic about high-priced mechanical keyboards are recommended to buy this less than 200 bucks Corsair K95. There are very few gamers who haven't actually heard about this keyboard. It has been the best since 2017. Even in 2021 Corsair K95 is a top choice for many in the gaming community. Cherry speed switches, 6 additional G keys, RGB lighting, detachable wrist rest are some of the cool features of which makes it perfect for our WOW players.</p>
<p>K95 Platinum has a brushed aluminium finish which provides a professional finish. Because of the aluminium finish K95 looks very nice but it attracts dust and requires frequent cleaning. 6 macro keys are given on the left side of the keyboard. The macro keys are highlighted with gray texture keycaps. You may program the macro keys to the function you prefer the most. Macro keys are very much helpful for the WOW players. On the top left of the keyboard we have a profile switching button, brightness key and a windows lock button. Top right section of the keyboard there are media keys, a volume wheel which is very large and smooth to use. 
</p>
<p>On the top of the keyboard there is a USB pass through which can be used for a mouse, headset or a flash drive. Due to the USB pass through the keyboard is containing two USB cables.

</p>

<p>The K95 Platinum keyboard uses the Cherry speed switches. The switches actuate at only 1.2 millimeter keypress which is very quick. The switches are faster than average mechanical switches. Razer Huntsman actuate at 1 millimeter which makes it faster and also comparatively very cheap. K95 switches are relatively quiet similar to the brown switches. There are three lighting effects pre saved on the keyboard which can be accessed through the profile switching buttons on the top of the keyboard without the software.

              <h2>Redragon K552</h2>
              
              <p><b>4.4 out of 5 & 19,074 global ratings at Amazon</b></p>

You can see the huge number of reviews and it’s growing exponentially day by day. Many gamers have trusted this cheap mechanical keyboard which makes it the best keyboard to play WOW shadowland. 
</p>
              <p>Redragon K552 is quite heavy and durable build quality because it is made of metal alloy and abs plastic. Also provide a key caps taking off tool along with the box. The USB with K552 is gold plated and the wire also looks very premium. As we all know that Cherry MX is the best mechanical keyboard switch available in the market. Redragon k552 mechanical keyboard uses Cherry MX red equivalent switches not exactly the real Cherry MX but according to the cheap price these switches are very amazing quality. The keycaps are very clicky and tactile so it’s not a good idea to use it at the office but in your room it’s perfectly fine if you love the sound of clicky keyboards. I personally find them very appealing. 
</p>
              <p>The keycaps have a significant amount of grip so it is super smooth to use. K552 is also an RGB gaming keyboard. RGB is a very important aspect for mechanical gaming keyboards.

              <h2>Corsair K55 RGB</h2>
              
              <p><b>4.7 out of 5 & 7,164 global ratings at Amazon</b></p>
              <p>Corsair is a renowned name in the world of premium quality mechanical gaming keyboards. Corsair K55 is a budget killer gaming keyboard for WOW players. Not being a mechanical keyboard doesn’t affect a bit on its super amazing performance. K55 is not only the cheapest gaming keyboard on the list but also the best quality in budget. The reason behind it’s under $50 price is that instead of using mechanical switches corsair used membrane switches.  
</p>
              <p>Corsair K55 offers tons of awesome features only for below 50 bucks. This keyboard is very much suitable for those who wish to get into the pc gaming community or those who are not willing to spend much for a quality gaming keyboard. On the left side there are 6 dedicated macro keys which is very rare for a keyboard at this price range also makes it very suitable for the WOW shadowland players. 
</p>
              <p>You can set certain functions or keys on these macros, they are also helpful for mobile players, video and photo editors. There is a macro record button on the top so you can easily configure the macro keys without the help of any software. Dedicated media keys on the top right hand side of the keyboard. Some features from the inside of the keyboard are anti ghosting and a key rollover. Also included detachable wrist rest which can be placed swiftly at the bottom of the keyboard but not it’s not magnetic. 
 
</p>
             <p>Membrane switches are not the best but according to the price range you can’t complain. RGB lights are also embedded inside the membrane switches and they shine through the white surface underneath all the keys. The RGB colors are very saturated and bright. No software is required to use the RGB. 3 zone RGB backlighting with 12 preconfigured lighting modes. You can press the “FN” key + (1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0/-/=) any of these keys to jump from one RGB pattern to another. The membrane switches don’t feel or sound like the mechanical keyboard. Mainly recommended for budget WOW gamers or entry level gamers.

                 Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition because of standard price, latest optomechanical switches, simple design and 1 mm keycap press with the fastest response.

                Most of the gamers prefer mechanical keyboards due to fast response, tactile and durable.

              <p>
                TKL (ten key less) and 60% keyboards are optimal for gamers because of better positioning.

               $100 to $150 is the sweet spot for gaming keyboards.

               No membrane keyboards are not that bad but mechanical keyboards are more enjoyable to use due to tactile switches and fast response.
