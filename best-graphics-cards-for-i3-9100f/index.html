          <h2>NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 2060 SUPER</h2>

          <p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER is the latest gaming graphics card from NVIDIA. It features a 1650 MHz boost clock and has 768 CUDA Cores with up to 41 RTX-OPS, giving it more than enough power for gaming at 1440p or in VR. Compared to its predecessor, this new gaming card also includes an improved memory bandwidth, with 14 Gbps of gaming-grade GDDRX RAM and 448 GB/s.<br><br>
In comparison to the GTX 1080 which is a more expensive card for gaming, this RTX 2060 SUPER features are comparable in terms of performance but at a lower price point which makes it one of the best i3 9100f graphics card. Another notable difference between these cards that you may want to consider is that the RTX 2060 SUPER has a lower power draw and is much quieter.<br><br>
I found gaming with this card to be really smooth. The FPS was pretty consistent, even in more demanding games like Fortnite Battle Royale at "Epic" graphics settings or Battlefield V at Ultra quality preset. Plus its overclocked performance means it can handle gaming at 1440p or even in VR.<br><br>
The GEFORCE RTX 2060 SUPER is a great choice for those who are looking to build their gaming PC and don't want the highest-priced card. Plus with this new graphics card, you'll be able to play amazing games like Battlefield V on Ultra quality, Fortnite on Epic quality, and more.<br><br>
The GEFORCE RTX 2060 SUPER has all of NVIDIA's latest and greatest gaming technology packed in. It also overclocks like crazy so when games get too demanding for your standard settings.<br><br>
Here's what you need to know about NVIDIA Geforce RTX 2060 Super:<br><br>
- It has 2176 CUDA cores which can be boosted up to 41 trillion operations per second (TeraFLOPS) - 6 Gigarays/s and 1470 MHz base clock speed<br><br>

- The card will come with an improved cooling solution that helps to keep gaming temperatures down

</p>
          
<div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
  <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
  <p> - gaming at 7680x4320 resolutions<br><br>
- About twice as fast as previous-generation cards in their gaming range, including the GeForce RTX 2060<br><br>
- Improved cooling solution that helps to keep gaming temperatures down. It features a new fan design and an advanced vapor chamber for higher air pressure and quieter performance than its predecessors.

</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
  <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
          <p> - gaming at 7680x4320 resolutions is possible, but not the best for gaming. The NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 2060 SUPER is better suited to gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution or lower which still provides an excellent gaming experience and will also be more likely stable for most gamers. For those that play games with extremely high graphics settings, gaming at 7680x4320 resolution should be avoided.<br><br>
- The GEFORCE RTX 2060 SUPER is still only viable for gaming once you’ve turned off some of the advanced anti-aliasing features that are usually required in gaming, such as NVIDIA DLSS and TAA.<br><br>
- If you have what is called “nongaming” work that is more demanding, there are better cards to consider.<br><br>
- It’s also worth noting that the card does consume more power than other cars in its class and will require a PSU of 600 watts to run without a problem.


</p>

          <h2>GIGABYTE RTX 2060 SUPER WINDFORCE OC 8G</h2>

          <p>The Gigabyte RTX 2060 SUPER WINDFORCE OC is an impressive gaming card with a 1680 MHz clock speed, which is 50MHz higher than the reference card.<br><br>
It has some nice overclocking features and it's made to run cool without any noise or throttling thanks to its Windforce cooler design that uses three 100mm fans that are set up to push air onto the backside of the card.<br><br>
Gigabyte is also using some gaming-focused features like a power boost, which helps provide extra overclocking potential with an external PCIe power connector for more than 50W.
The only downside I could find was its lack of RGB lighting and it has some gaming-specific features, but it does not have any analog inputs for a monitor.<br><br>
The Gigabyte RTX 2060 SUPER WINDFORCE OC is an impressive Core i3 9100f gaming card with cooling performance while running silently without throttling or noise.<br><br>
It's also designed to be able to run under the most intense gaming loads possible but is limited to gaming use.<br><br>
<b>GIGABYTE RTX 2060 SUPER WINDFORCE OC review</b><br><br>
I was ecstatic that I could play games on my PC at ultra settings and not have to worry about frame rates going below 30 fps like what would happen on my gaming laptop.<br><br>
So, the super gaming power in this card is definitely worth it if you are looking for something that will get you more frames per second than say a GTX 1070 or even an RTX 2070 and save some money while still getting decent gaming graphics. This card is also perfect for gaming at high settings on 1080p screens.<br><br>
I was worried I would have to buy a new monitor or my computer tower so the graphics card could handle gaming, but luckily it worked with the one that I already had which made me very happy and relieved.<br><br>
The only con about this gaming graphics card is that it doesn't come with an HDMI cable which was a little disappointing since I had to go out and buy one.<br><br>
However, if you're looking for something affordable but still great quality then the GIGABYTE RTX 2060 SUPER WINDFORCE OC should definitely be on your list.

<h3><b>Does i3 9100F need a graphics card?</b></h3>
<p>Intel core i3 9100f series processors have an integrated GPU, so they typically don't need a discrete graphics card. If you're going to be doing heavy gaming or video editing on your machine, then the answer is yes - but only if it meets certain requirements:<br><br>
- It needs to have a memory size that's at least as large or larger than the core i3 9100f-series processor.<br><br>
- The card should be no more than one generation older than your Intel core processor.<br><br>
If you're not going to be doing heavy gaming, then it depends on what tasks you'll be using your computer for. If you're looking to do things like video editing, then yes. Otherwise, no.

<h3><b>Is RTX 2060 compatible with i3 9100F?</b></h3>
<p>The RTX 2060 is not compatible with the Intel core i3 9100f-series. The only current GPU that can work on this processor is an AMD graphics card due to Intel's proprietary drivers for its own processors and chipsets. It has a max refresh rate of 60Hz, but it will be able to handle limited gaming when paired with an appropriate GPU.</p>
