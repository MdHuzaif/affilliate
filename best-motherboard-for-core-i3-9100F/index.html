               <p>Processor and Motherboard are the core components of a Computer. The performance of a computer depends on which processor and motherboard you are using. If either of these two key components is not up to the mark you will never get the desired performance. In order to have the best outcome from your computer you should consider spending some time reading about the specifications of both processors and motherboards and decide which suits your purpose the best. Performance of the processor depends on Core, Thread, Generation, Cache memory and the performance of the motherboard depends on the which chipset is being used, number of RAM slots, max memory support, number of PCIe slots, graphics type, number of M.2 slots, number of USB and generation of USB, Audio, LAN etc. 

               </p>
              <p>We will recommend you to consider spending some money on a top notch motherboard because Core i3 9100f is not a very high performance CPU so you will require external support for a better gaming performance. Cheap processor doesn’t necessarily mean poor gaming, rather you can upgrade your gaming performance with a high performance gaming motherboard, additional RAM, M.2 SSD and additional graphics card. By upgrading these elements you will surely get a high gaming performance with Core i3 9100f CPU.

</p>

<p>A genius work done by MSI in this motherboard is that the i/o housing is a part of the heatsink. Which is also known as an extended heatsink. This is a great innovation with a better heat dissipation system. The Z390 gaming motherboard has not only improved extended heatsink but also improved PWM design. So basically it can easily provide the power required for Core i3 9100f to Core i9 9900k power hungry gaming processors and it can keep them cool allowing best possible gaming performance. The designs on the extended heatsinks are very unique, attractive and premium. 
</p>

<p>MPG Z390 can serve the both purpose of being a light up RGB gaming look as well as normal premium showpiece look due to its RGB controller. There is a header where you can sync the Mystic light RGB with other devices such as a cooler master case and you can also set up different colors and patterns of RGB light using the customizing RGB controller. This allows MSI MPG Z390 to provide an amazing gaming look. Nowadays most of the gamers are crazy about RGB. The twin M.2 feature allows extremely fast boot up. USB 3.1 gen 2 available in both front and rear allows high speed data transfer. 
</p>

            <h2>Editor's Choice</h2>

             <p>After the discussion of 5 best motherboard for core i3 9100f we came to the conclusion that if you are heavy user and require a high budget gaming motherboard then duel M.2 MSI MPG Z390 is the best choice. Rather if you are a light user or wish to have a decent gaming performance with low budget then go for single M.2 GIGABYTE B365M DS3H. </p>
