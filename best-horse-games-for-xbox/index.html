          </div><br>
              <h2>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </h2>

              <p>Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has won many “game of the year” awards and a lot of praise from critics and fans. This is an action role playing horse related game of 2015 developed and published by CD Projekt Red. The story of Witcher 3 is based on Andrzej Sapkowski fantasy novels named “The Witcher”. The game is a third main installment of the Witcher series which is a sequel of previous Witcher 2 of 2011. We can play this Xbox one horse related game from a third person perspective in an open world. 
</p>

              <p>The main character of the game is Geralt of Rivia who is a hired monster slayer also known as a Witcher in a fictional fantasy world which is based on Slavonic mythology. Witcher is on the quest of his adopted daughter Ciri who is running away from an otherworldly wild hunt. The story of the game is very emotional and heartfelt. As this Xbox one game is an RPG (role playing game) so you will have to go through lots of secondary quests and witcher contracts to reach the required level to continue playing  the main quest. Tracking mysterious monsters and identifying where they are from and what is their weakness are included in the secondary quests. Crafting required signs and potions are necessary to beat them. There are so many unique monsters, places and stories. Which makes this game very amusing and adventurous. 
  </p>

              <p>The choice you make in each quest will add up and will have a future impact and consequences. The choices made in the beginning may have an impact in the ending of the game. Geralt’s lack of emotions in the story make him a very cool and interesting character. Garalt’s fearless character, emotionless attitude, trying to find and protect Ciri who is one of the few things Geralt really cares about. These things add up and create a really emotional story. The love triangle of Geralt, Yennefer and Tris is very dramatic and entertaining. Allowing the players to choose who Geralt ends up with is really an amazing idea. 
 </p>

 <p>The inevitable fight against the army of the wild hunt was grand and intense. It will give you a feeling of fighting an impossible fight. There are varieties of signs and potions for fighting. There is an alchemy tab in the game that is very amazing, it will allow you to research your enemies and get to know which potion will be effective against which monster. Players can battle with magic signs, potions and weapons, complete quests, interact with non-player characters, acquire points and gold, purchase equipment and increase Geralt’s sign, potion, gear abilities. 
</p>

<p>Geralt can move around the open world region riding on his horse named Roach. The world in Witcher 3 is vibrant and unique with spookie caves, snowy mountains, misty islands, bustling cities, farmlands, swamps and large castles. Players can kill enemies while riding Roach. The side quests and contracts include competing races in horseback, fistfight and addicting card game Gwent. The combination between Geralt and his horse Roach is going to be very fascinating for the horse game lovers of Xbox.
