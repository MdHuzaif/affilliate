             <p>In ear Headphones are the smallest ones. Smartphone manufacturers usually include them with their products. There are also two types of In Ear headphones they are wired ones and truly wireless ones. The wired ones are called in-ears and truly wireless ones are called “earbuds”. True wireless earbuds are most popular ones now a days due to their very small size and easy portability. </p>

              <h2>Pros:</h2>
             <p><b>Portable:</b> In Ear Headphones are most popular for their portability. True wireless earbuds also comes with a case which is used to charge the earbuds. The case is also light weight and small in size.  </p>

               <p><b>Noise Isolation: </b>Earbuds attach with the ears so because of the perfect fit they are good for noise isolation. It means they don’t allow any background noise to enter along with the music we are listening. Allow us to perfectly enjoy the track whatever the surrounding situation is.  </p>

               <p><b>Great for workout: </b>Though people use other types of headphones for workout but earbuds are mostly popular for workout. This is because their light weight and perfect fit in the ear. </p>

              <h2>Cons:</h2>
               <p><b>Sound quality: </b> In case of the budget in ear headphones which comes in comparatively lower price range, sound is not their strong point. Big over ear headphones can produce better sound because they have bigger sound drivers. In we are looking for low budget but high quality sound we should definitely go for the bigger ones.   </p>

               <p><b>Wires gets easily tangled:</b>This is not applicable for the truly wireless earbuds. But the wired ones easily get tangled all the time, which can be very irritating. </p>

               <p><b>Battery backup:</b>This is not applicable for wired in ears. True wireless Earbuds have very small sized battery. They are able to provide battery backup for about 5-10 hours. So they need to be charged frequently. We can easily charge the truly wireless earbuds 2 to 3 times with the case given with them. </p>

               <p><b>Battery: </b>For the wireless headphones battery is always a limitation. They have larger battery then other wireless headphones. 10-30 hours backup depending on the quality and price.

            <div class="about-content">
              <p>There are so many technical details related to a pair of headphones. If we wish to purchase a pair for ourselves should know the basic terms. Here are some worth mentioning terms frequently used to express the technical details of headphones.</p>
             <p><b>Impedance: </b>The impedance of the headphones should match with the device we are using such as music player or smartphones. The headphones that comes with low impedance like 16 to 32 ohms require less power to drive the high audio level. Music player or headphones have low amplification ability. So low impedance headphones are suitable to use with headphones and music players.   </p>

             <p>On the other hand high impedance headphones require more power to deliver acceptable audio level. Studio professional headphones are high impedance headphones. Their impedance is very high for example 205 ohms. These headphones need dedicated amplifiers to drive it. So before buying headphones we should see the impedance carefully to make sure if we require any additional amplifier or not. 
             </p>

               <p><b>Sensitivity: </b>The term sensitivity refers to the volume level of the headphones. It specifies how loud a pair of headphones can get. Most headphones have sensitivity around 96-110 db approximately. Sensitivity below 85 db would be too soft and should be avoided. Above 110 db should also be avoided because they can damage our hearing.   </p>

                 <p><b>Drivers:</b> Drivers of the headphones convert the electrical signal into sound pressure. Better sound quality depends mostly on the size of the drivers. The bigger the drives are the better the sound gets. Drives boosts the bass, mids and the treble, which causes an enjoyable music experience. Two driver technologies are available balanced armature and dynamic. Balanced armature drives are tuned to sound good in a specific frequency range. They also allow better isolation because of not having a vent within. Dynamic drivers have superior bass quality. Dynamic drives are comparatively more cheap and durable than balanced armature drivers.   </p>

               <p><b>Frequency Response:</b>Frequency Response means the range of sound which the headphone is able to produce. It is measured in hertz (Hz). Usually the frequency range of the most of the headphones are 20-20000 Hz. Because this is the hearing sound range of humans. Headphones are also manufactured in the same frequency range. Some headphones extends the range from the both sides in order to provide deeper responses. These sounds can’t be heard but can be felt to a small extent along with the audible range. A wider range always allows better tone, responses and handling in midrange low and highs. Most people can’t even realize the difference so it’s not the most important aspect of headphones of average customers.   </p>

                <p><b>Noise Isolation vs. Active Noise Cancellation: </b>These two terms are very close but the meaning is very different. Noise isolation simple mean that the headphone sits between the ears and outside sound. So they block the outside noise from entering into the ear. </p>
<p>Active noise cancellation (ANC) working procedure is a bit different. Their main goal is same but work in different method. Product that have active noise cancellation have a tiny microphone in them that pick up outside sounds. After the reception the headphones produce the opposite sound waves in order to actively cancel out unwanted noise. This feature drains the battery backup of wireless headphones lot faster than the headphones with noise isolation. I case we are in very noisy environment, travel or airplane this feature would be really helpful. Some modes of headphones can adjust the level of Active Noise Cancellation. They comes at a bit costly price.
