<b>Is i3 8100 enough for gaming?</b><br><br>
The gaming community has been asking the question "Is i3 8100 enough for gaming?" This article will answer that question. The Intel Core i3-8100 is a quad core processor, with hyperthreading and an L2 cache of 3 MB. It is at the level of a Core i5-7500 as it also features 4 threads with no hyperthreading.<br><br>
It has higher base clock speed than the Core i5-7500 but lower turbo boost frequency. The IPC improvements from this newer generation are also present in the Core i3 processors, which means they should perform better than older models when running single-threaded tasks.
Overall, the performance of this CPU is good for gaming even though it has a lower turbo frequency.
